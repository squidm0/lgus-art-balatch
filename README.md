**Disclaimer:** Please forgive the blatant copying of verbiage from [jimbos-big-naturals](https://github.com/prettypinkpansy/jimbos-big-naturals). [prettypinkpansy ](https://github.com/prettypinkpansy) did such a good job explaining how to install their mod that we figured we wouldn't try to reinvent the wheel.

L. Gus's Custom Deck Art is a very simple edit of Balatro's existing assets to use custom deck art in place of the standard face cards.

The art swap only works with the non-high-contrast deck. It has not been tested with collab art decks, but it seems likely that it will work fine.

## Installation

This mod does not require any modloaders or anything - installing it is very simple. It's just a zip, some folders, and some PNG files (images). Balatro is built on a simple platform, and so you can open its EXE file like a ZIP file to view its internal files... and replace them too! That's how the mod is installed.

**You will need 7zip**, or a program with similar capability to open non-zip files as zips. [Download 7zip here](https://www.7-zip.org/). Fortunately, 7zip is free open source zip software.

### Windows/Steam

1. [Download LGusArtBalatch.zip from the latest releases here.](https://github.com/squidm0/lgus-art-balatch/releases/latest)
2. **Navigate to your Balatro installation folder.** This is probably something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro`.
3. **Extract LGusArtBalatch.zip.** You should have a folder in your Balatro directory now.
4. **Right click on `Balatro.exe` in your Balatro installation folder**. A reminder you'll need 7zip or similar for this. You may need to click "Show more options" on later versions of Windows. Under the options it should say 7zip. Hover over it to reveal some options.

1. Under 7zip click **Open archive**.
2. Go into the **LGusArtMod folder**. Grab the **resources** folder and drag it over into your 7zip window, as shown below.

That's it! If you'd like to uninstall the mod, the "original-files-backup" folder in LGusArtMod has a resources folder with the original deck. Just repeat steps 4 through 6 with that folder instead.
